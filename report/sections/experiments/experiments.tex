\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

We conduct two different experiments in the following sections to evaluate the \ac{hake} technique for link prediction.
While both use the same setup and evaluation methods, they examine different aspects of the technique.
In Section~\ref{sec:setup}, we cover the setup of both experiments as well as the metrics used for evaluation.
Section~\ref{sec:replication} and~\ref{sec:domain-specific} explain the different experiments and present their results.
