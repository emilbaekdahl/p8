\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

From the experiments in the previous section, we found problems with result replication of the \ac{hake} paper and that the technique does not perform well on domain-specific data.
In this section, we provide possible explanations for those encountered problems, and discuss how future research may address the link prediction problem differently.
