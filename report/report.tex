\title{Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs Using Graph Embedding}
\author{Emil S. BÃ¦kdahl \\ \url{ebakda16@student.aau.dk} \\ Group d806f20}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  \Aclp{kb} are becoming increasingly popular in both academia and industry since they provide an intuitive way to reason about data and thus can support decision making.
  Recently, an interest in inferring new knowledge from existing \aclp{kb} has seen a rise.
  For instance, in the medical domain, inference can be used to propose new drugs or treatments for known diseases.
  In this project, we examine a state-of-the-art approach to this problem that uses graph embeddings to predict missing links in \aclp{kb}.
  Particularly, we focus on a recent approach called the \acl{hake} and evaluate its performance on existing and new datasets.
  As a conclusion, we are not able to reproduce the results of the associated paper, and experiments on a new domain-specific dataset exhibit significantly poor performance.
