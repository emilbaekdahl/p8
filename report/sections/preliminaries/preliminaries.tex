\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

In the following, we cover a number of topics that lay the foundation for the \ac{hake} technique and how it is used for link prediction.
In Section~\ref{sec:knowledge-bases}, we introduce \acp{kb} at the conceptual level and describe a way of representing them as graphs.
Section~\ref{sec:embedding} focuses on graph embedding and how they can be used for link prediction
