\section{The \ac{hake} Technique}\label{sec:method}

This section will cover the intuition behind the \ac{hake} technique and how it is used for link prediction.
We start, in Section~\ref{sec:representing-hieraricies}, by giving an intuitive understanding of the technique by introducing its overall goal and concrete concepts.
In Section~\ref{sec:learning}, we take a look at how these concepts are deployed in a learning setting.
